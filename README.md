# P5.Create

I created p5.create as a games development libary as part of my games development unit course work since the recommend games development libary had far to many uncessary features which would slow down my development so instead I created p5.create which had the bare minimum to make games development in p5.js simple!

You can see the game I created using this libary [on my website] as part of my games development unit coursework.



## Development
